# **Sports Scheduler**

## **Overview**
**Sports Scheduler** is my capstone project for Full Stack Web Development. It is a full-stack web application built using **Express.js**, **Node.js**, and **PostgreSQL**. The application provides a platform for administrators to create and manage sports and for participants to create and join sports sessions.

This project showcases my ability to build secure, user-friendly, and dynamic web applications with a robust backend and an interactive frontend.
